### Site contents

This site provides access to technical reports related to the [Recreational Potential model for Scotland](https://github.com/BioDT/uc-ces-recreation), which was developed by the [UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/) as part of the [BioDT project](https://biodt.eu/). The documents contained herein can also be accessed in PDF form from the NERC Open Research Archive at **insert url**.

- The [Summary](summary.html) document provides a high-level overview of the Recreational Model and the research context in which it came about.

- The [Technical Supplement](tech_supp.html) goes into greater detail regarding the data, code and mathematics underpinning the model. This document would be useful for someone aiming to understand the full process, starting from the download of ‘raw’ datasets, and following through all the way to the final output values.

- The [Developers' Report](dev_report.html) provides an account of development work carried out between November 2024 and June 2025, and makes detailed recommendations for further development work. It would be useful for someone intending to continue development of this model.

- The [Worked Example](example.html) demonstrates basic usage of the model in `R`.
