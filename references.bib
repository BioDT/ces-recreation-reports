  abstract     = {Digital twin approaches have the potential to revolutionise usage, planning and management of cultural ecosystem services i.e. the non-material benefits people obtain from ecosystems, including recreation, tourism, intellectual development, spiritual enrichment, reflection and aesthetic experiences.

Here, we outline our blueprint for a prototype digital twin (pDT) for cultural ecosystem services. The pDT consists of two modelling components; a recreation potential model to quantify the cultural ecosystem services of the physical landscape and species distribution models to quantify the biodiversity component.

It is envisaged that the digital twin will be used primarily by two user types: 1. those who wanted to enjoy the area and potentially contribute to citizen science programmes and 2. people who want to inform or make evidence-based management decisions (land managers, policy-makers, researchers).},

  abstract     = {There is often pressure on protected area managers to enhance wild landscapes and protect biodiversity while simultaneously promoting goals such as assuring ongoing provision of ecosystem services and providing for tourist and recreational needs. In the current study, we investigate two tools that may provide different types of management-relevant knowledge on recreation ecosystem services to aid management decisions in a protected area (PA), particularly where such tradeoffs must be considered. We constructed a spatial recreational model of the whole Cairngorms National Park, Scotland (ESTIMAP-Recreation), parameterised by hard and soft recreationalists (providing “where and what” types of knowledge). We then conducted 33 interviews with managers, residents, and visitors, asking if and how they considered the resulting maps useful. In parallel, we conducted focused walking interviews in two contrasting park sites, favoured by hard and soft recreationalist to determine if it was possible to gain further insight into other aspects of the recreational ecosystem services (the “why”). These walking interviews were conducted in a woodland adjacent to an urban area (30 interviews) and in a wild landscape mountain area (22 interviews). The complimentary nature of these approaches highlights the diverse sources of knowledge PA managers may exploit to assist in managing the many conflicting objectives imposed upon them.},

ESTIMAP (“Ecosystem Service Mapping Tool”) is a collection of spatially explicit models, originally developed to support policies at a European scale. We based our analysis on 10 case studies, and 3 ES models. Each case study applied at least one model at a local scale. We analyzed the applications with respect to: the adaptation process; the “precision differential” which we define as the variation generated in the model between the degree of spatial variation within the spatial distribution of ES and what the model captures; the stakeholders’ opinions on the usefulness of models. We propose a protocol for adapting ESTIMAP to the local conditions. We present the precision differential as a means of assessing how the type of model and level of model adaptation generate variation among model outputs. We then present the opinion of stakeholders; that in general considered the approach useful for stimulating discussion and supporting communication. Major constraints identified were the lack of spatial data with sufficient level of detail, and the level of expertise needed to set up and compute the models.},

  abstract     = {Research on ecosystem services mapping and valuing has increased significantly in recent years. However, compared to provisioning and regulating services, cultural ecosystem services have not yet been fully integrated into operational frameworks. One reason for this is that transdisciplinarity is required to address the issue, since by definition cultural services (encompassing physical, intellectual, spiritual interactions with biota) need to be analysed from multiple perspectives (i.e. ecological, social, behavioural). A second reason is the lack of data for large-scale assessments, as detailed surveys are a main source of information. Among cultural ecosystem services, assessment of outdoor recreation can be based on a large pool of literature developed mostly in social and medical science, and landscape and ecology studies. This paper presents a methodology to include recreation in the conceptual framework for EU wide ecosystem assessments (Maes et al., 2013), which couples existing approaches for recreation management at country level with behavioural data derived from surveys and population distribution data. The proposed framework is based on three components: the ecosystem function (recreation potential), the adaptation of the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum framework to characterise the ecosystem service and the distribution of potential demand in the EU. Results show that 38% of the EU is characterised by a high outdoor recreation potential, which is easily accessible, and that such areas can host about 35.4% of potential demand for close-to-home trips (<8 km). This proportion increases to 37.6% for long distance travelling (<80 km). The analysis framework can be applied to quantify the availability of outdoor recreation potential as an ecosystem service to EU citizens, to describe through country profiles differences in ecosystem service provision at regional level, and can be used as an input to land use planning processes.},

  abstract    = {Interviews were conducted at British Ecological Society meetings in Liverpool 10-13 Dec 2024. The interviews consisted of an introduction to the digital twin and an invitation to provide personal views via a semi-structured feedback tool accessed by a QR code or on paper. The interviews focused on (i) the graphical user interface, (ii) the components of both the (ii) recreational and (iii) species distribution models and (iv) the sustainability of the digital twin following the completion of the BioDT research project. For the graphical user interface and the models, the format was bold statements which the interviewee had to mark their level of agreement using a 5-point Likert scale. If the interviewee was unfamiliar with the technical details of anything e.g. species distribution models they were invited to select the neutral option. If they disagreed with the statement or had additional thoughts, they were encouraged to write them in the open question which followed the Likert scale question. The prototype digital twin trailed with participants was demonstrated and a handout explaining the main features given to 77 people, 58 provided feedback via the tool and one sent an email with their thoughts (75% response rate). The prototype digital twin (pDT) was well received with the concept of linking recreational potential maps with the probability of viewing biodiversity considered very relevant. The overall conclusions were: • Most respondents considered the three base maps provided in the digital twin sufficient (74%) but several commented that the addition of the OS map or a cost-effect alternative would be helpful. • Most respondents agreed that the filters were a useful addition to the graphical user interface of the pDT for both the recreational potential (78%) and species (93%) occurrence but questioned why it was possible to move the slider in both directions. • Most respondents (88%) agreed that viewing the probability of encountering a specific species or multiple species (e.g. all birds) was valuable. • The colour scheme was questioned by many respondents even when they scored the question positively. Many recognised that there was a lot of information to impart but considered the present colour scheme unclear. • The use of additional tabs such as viewing supplementary information on other web sites or apps was welcomed with suggestions in addition to the biodiversity including route planners, public transport routes and timetables, and weather apps. • There was general agreement that the recreational potential model incorporated the main elements (72%) but concern that the user may need to parameterise the model with 87 parameters, the concept of personas to choose from and only alter specific parameters of interest to the user was suggested. • Over 90% of respondents considered the 20 m resolution of the digital twin output map sufficient but many respondents considered that both the recreational potential and biodiversity data should be seasonally adjusted and not only updated an annually. • Species distribution models were considered a sensible approach for the biodiversity aspect of the digital twin, but it was recommended by many respondents that other biodiversity datasets not just citizen science data should be used. • Funding to ensure sustainability of the prototype digital twin from some government source was favoured by 81% of respondents. The reason given were typically either because they considered the digital twin a public good or because restricting the knowledge was seen as fostering inequality or they did not think private subscription would be commercially viable. Many people were complimentary on the work completed so far writing statements such as Congratulations, amazing tool, and Great job!!!},

To date there have been few studies examining the output from LTSER platforms. In this study we enquire if the socio-ecological research from 25 self-selected LTSER platforms of the International Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network has produced research products which fulfil the aims and ambitions of the paradigm shift from ecological to socio-ecological research envisaged at the turn of the century. In total we assessed 4983 publically available publications, of which 1112 were deemed relevant to the socio-ecological objectives of the platform. A series of 22 questions were scored for each publication, assessing relevance of responses in terms of the disciplinary focus of research, consideration of human health and well-being, degree of stakeholder engagement, and other relevant variables. The results reflected the diverse origins of the individual platforms and revealed a wide range in foci, temporal periods and quantity of output from participating platforms, supporting the premise that there is a growing trend in socio-ecological research at long-term monitoring platforms. Our review highlights the challenges of realizing the top-down goal to harmonize international network activities and objectives and the need for bottom-up, self-definition for research platforms. This provides support for increasing the consistency of LTSER research while preserving the diversity of regional experiences.},
