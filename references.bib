Recently the attention on spatially explicit ways to map ecosystem services, at local, regional and global scale is increasing. This report presents ESTIMAP: a suite of models for a spatially explicit assessment of three ecosystem services (recreation, pollination and coastal protection) at continental scale. The main objective of the models is to support EU policies with information on ecosystem services.},
