    "section": "2 Background",
    "text": "2 Background\nThe Recreational Potential model described here has a direct ancestor in ESTIMAP (Ecosystem Service Mapping Tool), which was a collection of models used to produce spatially explicit assessments of ecosystem services, including recreation, at a European scale (Paracchini et al., 2014; Zulian et al., 2013).\nSome years later, Zulian et al. (2018) proposed a protocol for adapting ESTIMAP to local conditions, based on an analysis of case studies involving ESTIMAP and incorporating feedback from stakeholders. This work was part of the OpenNESS project (2012-17), focusing on Long Term Socio-Ecological Research Platforms (LTSER) (Dick et al., 2018).\nDick et al. (2022) adapted the ESTIMAP tool to focus specifically on Recreational Potential in the Cairngorms. They adjusted the parameters of the tool to match two archetypes with different preferences for recreational activities (these are the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ recreationalist personas described later), and conducted interviews with stakeholders to assess how useful the tool was.\nEarlier on in the BioDT project (2022-25), the RP and biodiversity models were combined as part of the ‘beta’ version of the BioDT app.2 However, at that time the models was limited to pre-calculated ‘static’ raster layers covering a small region (the Cairngorms National Park) rather than all of Scotland (Rolph et al., 2024). Dick, Carbone, et al. (2025) gathered feedback on this tool via a survey and interviews at the British Ecological Society annual meeting in December 2024.\nIn the months since, development work has focused on improving the speed and scalability of these components, to enable the interactive and personalisable experience that was envisaged. The model was rewritten from scratch and a new Shiny app developed that was able to leverage these efficiencies. It was released as ‘version 1.0’ upon the close of the BioDT project (Marsh Rossney et al., 2025), and is available on GitHub under an open-source license.\nThe SPEAK project followed in the same spirit as (Dick et al., 2022), but using the updated Recreational Potential model, which allows for greater individual customisation by users. Some preliminary findings from this study are available as a conference presentation (Dick, Carbone, et al., 2025) and workshop report (Dick, Andrews, et al., 2025).\nA retrospective look at the CES part of the BioDT project will be published shortly under Rolph, Carbone, Williams, Andrews, Martinovič, et al. (2025)."

    "section": "3 Model description",
    "text": "3 Model description\n\n3.1 Overview\nTo describe the Recreational Potential model we will start from its outputs and work backwards.\nThe main model output is an two-dimensional array of numbers (a raster) representing an Recreational Potential value (RP value) between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) for each 20x20 metre square area of land (pixel) within a given area, with higher values indicating greater Recreational Potential for that specific persona. These RP values can then be mapped to colours and displayed as a heat map over a map of Scotland, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example of a heat map displaying Recreational Potential.\n\n\n\nAn RP value is constructed from a combination of 87 items representing distinct attributes of the land. The 87 items are grouped into four components, which are outlined in Table 1. RP values are calculated by weighting each item by a score between \\(0\\) and \\(10\\) that reflects the importance of that item to the user. A full set of 87 scores is referred to as a persona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nShort code\n# items\n\n\n\n\nLandscape - the suitability of land to support recreational activity\nSLSRA\n40\n\n\nNatural Features influencing the potential\nFIPS_N\n24\n\n\nInfrastructure features influencing the potential\nFIPS_I\n10\n\n\nWater - rivers and lakes\nWater\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The four components contributing to Recreational Potential values.\n\n\n\nThe RP model thus requires two inputs from users:\n\nA persona, i.e. the 87 scores for each item/feature, contained in a .csv file.\nA region of interest, i.e. an area within Scotland in which to calculate RP values, given by either a shapefile or the four coordinates of a bounding box.\n\nWe will often refer to the computations that produce an RP raster from the two user inputs as the ‘dynamic’ part of the RP model, since these computations must be performed each time the user makes a change to their persona or region of interest.\n\n\n3.2 Persona\nAs previously stated, a persona is nothing more than a set of 87 numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(10\\) corresponding to each of the 87 items.\nPersonas are stored in .csv files. However, the interactive R Shiny app provided with the model (Section 4.7) contains a convenient interface for loading, saving and editing personas. Figure 2 is a screenshot from this app, showing some example persona scores for the Water component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example set of persona scores for the ‘Water’ component.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Input data\nThere is another essential set of inputs to the model which are not specified by the user. These are a set of 87 raster layers — one for each of the 87 items — covering Scotland at a resolution of 20x20m.\nFor items belonging to the Landscape (SLSRA) component or the Natural Features component (FIPS_N), these rasters contain just ones and zeros, with \\(1\\) indicating presence of the feature in that pixel and \\(0\\) indicating absence.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{SLSRA}_j = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if feature} \\; j \\; \\text{present in pixel} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if feature} \\; j \\; \\text{absent in pixel}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFor items belonging to the Infrastructure (FIPS_I) component or the Water (Water) component, the input rasters contain values between zero and one.\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Water}_j = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if feature} \\; j \\; \\text{present in pixel} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if feature} \\; j \\;\\gtrapprox 500\\text{m away} \\\\\nu(\\mathrm{distance}_j) & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{distance}_j\\) is the distance to the nearest pixel in which the feature \\(j\\) is present, and \\(u(\\mathrm{distance})\\) is a function that maps distances to values between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), decreasing as the distance increases and falling to zero at approximately 500m (see Section 1, Technical Supplement for details).\nThus, \\(1\\) still indicates presence of the feature in that pixel, but \\(0\\) instead indicates that the feature is not only absent in that pixel, but all surrounding pixels within 500m. The range of values between zero and one are used to signify that the feature is nearby (within 500m), but not present in this pixel itself.\nThis continuous scale allows the RP model to incorporate how areas near e.g., a loch, can still contribute to the recreational potential, even if they do not directly contain the feature.\nFigure 3 contrasts a presence/absence raster (lowlands) with a proximity raster (minor rivers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An example of a presence/absence raster (left) and a proximity raster (right) covering the same region just south of Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Recreational Potential calculation\nEach of the four components is calculated by multiplying the item/features by the corresponding persona score, summing, and normalising the result,\n\\[\n\\mathrm{SLSRA} = \\mathrm{normalise}\\left( \\sum_j \\mathrm{Score}^{(\\text{SLSRA})}_j \\times \\mathrm{SLSRA}_j \\right) \\, .\n\\]\nIn this context, ‘normalisation’ means transforming the values so that they lie between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), through the following transformation:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{normalise}(x) = \\frac{x - x_\\text{min}}{x_\\text{max} - x_\\text{min}} \\, .\n\\]\nThe final RP value is calculated by summing these four components and normalising once more,\n\\[\n\\mathrm{RP} = \\mathrm{normalise} \\left( \\mathrm{SLSRA} + \\mathrm{FIPS\\_N} + \\mathrm{FIPS\\_I} + \\mathrm{Water} \\right) \\, .\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of changing the region of interest\n\n\n\nAn important detail is that the normalisation step depends on the minimum and maximum values within the chosen region of interest. This means that running the model with a different region of interest (e.g. over a larger area) will generally yield different values for the same locations, even if both the persona and the underlying data are unchanged.\n\n\nThe dynamic part of the model is depicted in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n subgraph s1[\"'Dynamic' computation of Recreational Potential\"]\n        D[\"Crop the 4&lt;br&gt;component rasters to the&lt;br&gt;region of interest\"]\n        E[\"Calculate each&lt;br&gt;component\"]\n        F[\"Normalise each&lt;br&gt;component\"]\n        G[\"Sum&lt;br&gt;components\"]\n        H[\"Normalise\"]\n  end\n    A([\"&lt;i&gt;User input:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Persona scores\"]) ---&gt; E\n    B([\"&lt;i&gt;User input:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Region of interest\"]) --&gt; D\n    C[(\"&lt;i&gt;Fixed input:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raster data\")] --&gt; D\n    D --&gt; E\n    E --&gt; F\n    F --&gt; G\n    G --&gt; H\n    H --&gt; I((\"RP value\"))\n    style s1 fill:#FFF9C4\n    style A color:#000000\n    style B color:#000000\n    style C color:#000000\n    style D color:#000000\n    style E color:#000000\n    style F color:#000000\n    style G color:#000000\n    style H color:#000000\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A breakdown of the ‘dynamic’ part of the Recreational Potential model, that responds to changes in user input."

This has a number of advantages compared with a stand-alone script, since the standardised setup allows us to leverage tools for installing, documenting and testing the code, and managing its dependencies on other packages.\nIn particular, the package may be installed by passing the GitHub repository to remotes::install_github (or the devtools function with the same name).\nremotes::install_github(\"BioDT/uc-ces-recreation\")\nThis will install the package, which is named biodt.recreation. It will also install the packages upon which biodt.recreation depends, which are listed under Imports in the DESCRIPTION file.\nFunctionality is provided through a collection of functions in the R/ directory that, after installing the package, are accessible to the user in the biodt.recreation namespace. That is, functions such as compute_potential are accessed using the syntax biodt.function::compute_potential, or by name alone after exposing the whole namespacing using library(biodt.recreation).\nDocumentation for these functions is contained in the .Rd files within the man/ directory. This documentation can be brought up in RStudio by typing in ? followed by the function name. For example, typing in ?compute_potential opens the page shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: An example of rendered documentation in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Downloading the input data\nInput data for the RP model is not available in precisely the form required by the model, as described in Section 3.3. Rather, these input rasters are obtained through a series of processing steps which combine and transform ‘raw’ data downloaded from various open-access datasets.\nCurrently, this ‘data production’ process is split into a manual stage and an automated stage. The automated stage is carried out by a script in the inst/scripts/data_production/ directory.\nHowever, users need not run this script; the data which it produces is stored on Dropbox3 and can be downloaded by calling a function provided by the package.\n# Allow 10 minutes for the download before timing out!\noptions(timeout=600)  \n\nbiodt.recreation::download_data()\n\n\n4.5 Calculation of RP values\nAs stated earlier, the RP model requires two user inputs to run: a persona and a region of interest.\nFor this demonstration, we will use one of the ‘preset’ personas, which is loaded using the function get_example_persona(). We will also load an example bounding box which covers an area just south of Edinburgh.\nThe following snippet of code demonstrates how to compute Recreational Potential. The function also returns each component individually.\nlibrary(biodt.recreation)\n\npersona &lt;- get_example_persona()\nbbox &lt;- get_example_bbox()\n\nlayers &lt;- compute_potential(persona, bbox)\nThe output of this function, layers, is a five-layered raster, whose layers are the four component layers plus the RP layer, as described in Section 3.4.\n\n\n4.6 ‘Preset’ personas\nThe code snippet above made use of two convenience functions for constructing a persona and a bounding box.\nA persona is represented by a very specific type of object in R (a named vector with 87 elements and specific names). It is therefore unlikely that users will want to create one from scratch without using the Shiny app interface.\nWe provide two ‘preset’ personas along with the package. These are\n\nHard Recreationalist: this persona values remote, challenging environments and avoids built-up or highly managed areas.\nSoft Recreationalist: this persona values tranquil, accessible landscapes and natural water features, and avoids steep or harsh terrain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigins of the Hard/Soft Recreationalist personas\n\n\n\nThese personas can be traced back to the study by Dick et al. (2022, p. 5), from which we quote:\n\nTwo individuals were selected and invited to parameterise the model because they were both users of the [Cairngorms National Park] for recreation and considered by park officials as typical of the spectrum of recreational users of the area (local and visitors)… The self-reported soft recreationalist was a staff member of CNPA who had never climbed a ‘Munro’ (a hill over 3000 ft – a common measurement of hiking capability and achievement in the area) and the hard recreationalist regularly hill walked and had completed over 200 Munros.\n\n\n\nPreset personas can be loaded into an R session as follows:\n# Get the path to the preset persona file\npersona_file &lt;- get_preset_persona_file()\n\n# Load the Hard Recreationalist persona\nhard_recreationalist &lt;- load_persona(persona_file, \"Hard_Recreationalist\")\n\n# Load the Soft Recreationalist persona\nsoft_recreationalist &lt;- load_persona(persona_file, \"Soft_Recreationalist\")\nIn fact the function get_example_persona() loads the Hard Recreationalist persona.\nThe strongest preferences of the Hard Recreationalist persona are highlighted in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore_group\nfeatures\n\n\n\n\nhighest scores (scored 10 or 9)\nRock Walls (FIPS_N), Mountains (FIPS_N), Inland cliffs, rock pavements and outcrops (SLSRA), Rock cliffs, ledges and shores (SLSRA), National Park (SLSRA)\n\n\nlowest scores (scored 0 or 1)\nBuilt-up areas (FIPS_N), Flood plain (FIPS_N), Depressions (FIPS_N), No slope (FIPS_N), Gentle slope (FIPS_N), Country Park (SLSRA), Raised and blanket bog (SLSRA), Valley mires, poor fens and transition mires (SLSRA), Windthrown woodland (SLSRA), Woodland fringes and clearings and tall forb stands (SLSRA), Bare field or exposed soil (SLSRA), Built-up area (SLSRA), Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Reserve (SLSRA), Pond (Water), Motorway (FIPS_I), A Road (FIPS_I), B Road (FIPS_I), Minor or local road (FIPS_I), Access roads or Track (FIPS_I), Saltings (FIPS_N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Highest and lowest scores in the Hard Recreationalist persona.\n\n\n\n\nThe strongest preferences of the Soft Recreationalist persona are highlighted in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore_group\nfeatures\n\n\n\n\nhighest scores (scored 10 or 9)\nTraffic Free: Paved Surface (FIPS_I), Coastal dunes and sandy shore (SLSRA), National Park (SLSRA), Major Lochs (Water), Beaches or Dunes (FIPS_N), No slope (FIPS_N), Freshwater (SLSRA), Mixed deciduous and coniferous woodland (SLSRA), Scots pine woodland (SLSRA), Broadleaved deciduous woodland (SLSRA)\n\n\nlowest scores (scored 0 or 1)\nRock Walls (FIPS_N), Built-up areas (FIPS_N), Rocks or Scree (FIPS_N), Depressions (FIPS_N), Extremely steep slope (FIPS_N), Screes (SLSRA), Windthrown woodland (SLSRA), Bare field or exposed soil (SLSRA), Unnamed minor stream or tributary (Water), Motorway (FIPS_I), A Road (FIPS_I), Saltings (FIPS_N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Highest and lowest scores in the Soft Recreationalist persona.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Shiny app\nAs part of the SPEAK study an R Shiny app was developed that focused exclusively on the Recreational Potential model. This is provided alongside the main package, since it provides a convenient, dynamic interface for testing and visualising outputs.\nThe source code for the app is split across several files, each containing the app_ prefix:\n\napp_ui.R contains a function make_ui that returns the user interface (UI), i.e. the layout of the Shiny app, sliders, map, buttons etc.\napp_server.R contains a function make_server that returns the server function, which defines the dynamic parts of the app, such as loading/saving/editing personas and drawing a rectangle on the map.\napp_theme.R contains some custom UI elements such as the colour scheme and logo.\napp_text.R contains the extended text elements of the app, such as the user guide.\napp_run.R contains a convenience function run_app for running the app.\n\nThe app can be run from an R session by calling the run_app() function:\nbiodt.recreation::run_app()\nThe result should look like Figure 6.\nIf you are in RStudio this should launch the app in a separate pane. To launch the app in your default browser, you can pass the option launch.browser = TRUE to the function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A screenshot of the R Shiny App developed specifically for the RP model for use in the SPEAK study.\n\n\n\nDetailed instructions for using the app are contained within the app itself, in the ‘User Guide’ tab. However, the essential steps are:\n\nCreate a persona using the ‘Persona’ tab.\nDraw a box on the map by clicking the square orange button and dragging your mouse over the map.\nClick the ‘Update Map’ button to compute the Recreational Potential value."

Issues and suggestions of a more technical nature are discussed in the developer’s report.\n\nThe RP maps can be insufficiently detailed and sometimes important features such as footpaths are missing. This is due to the underlying data being either inaccurate, out of date, or of insufficient resolution to resolve these features.\nThe model outputs lack important information relevant to recreational activities, such as information about toilets, parking etc.\nLinear features such as paths and rivers are hard to discern. This is due to the fact that proximity to rather than presence of these features contributes to the RP value, so a road appears on the map as a thick band.\nThe current set of 87 items that users must score includes many feature types that many lay users will not be familiar with — what is a “moraine” anyway?\nThe RP values depend on the region of interest specified. Hence, if the region of interest is changed (e.g. by drawing a smaller box on the map) the RP values will likely change, even if the persona scores are unchanged. This is due to the ‘normalisation’ step.\nThe influence of the persona scores on the output RP values is not transparent and sometimes counter-intuitive. Scoring an entire component with high (low) values does not necessarily mean the component will contribute more (less) to the RP. In fact, only differences in scores within a component translate into differences in RP values. This is again due to the ‘normalisation’ step."

    "section": "8 Future directions",
    "text": "8 Future directions\nWe see several potential avenues for further research and development work. Again, more technical detail on these suggestions is provided in the developer’s report.\n\nSimplifying feature scoring:\nWhile the current set of 87 items allows for a detailed definition of a persona, this can be very time-consuming for users, especially if they are unfamiliar with many of the feature types. Further work could look at grouping similar features into broader thematic categories (e.g. ‘mountain terrain’, ‘urban infrastructure’, ‘wetlands’) to make the scoring process more intuitive and efficient. The option of scoring items at a finer level of detail could be retained for the benefit of expert users.\nAn expanded set of ‘preset’ personas could be an additional convenience. These could include personas calibrated for cyclists, families, hikers, birdwatchers etc.\nMake the effect of user inputs on RP values more intuitive:\nAs discussed above, the effect of adjusting personas scores or the region of interest on the RP values is likely to be a source of confusion. Future updates to the model should prioritise intuitive behaviour and transparency. Removing the normalisation of components would go a long way to meet these objectives.\nPeriodically update the underlying datasets:\nSome of the datasets used in the current version of the model will become outdated as landscapes change or improved data becomes available. Periodically updating the datasets is therefore important to maintain relevance of the model. This could be achieved by replacing the manual ‘offline’ data production process with an automated ‘online’ process that is triggered periodically, e.g. when a dataset is updated. Doing this would also allow the model to be updated based on the weather or season, and in doing so account for flood risk, trail closures etc.\nHowever, the frequency with which to update these datasets should be determined by balancing the needs of users with the monetary and environmental cost of the data acquisition and processing pipeline.\nIntegrate with third-party apps or services:\nIt may be worth considering whether integrating the BioDT app with third party data services may be more efficient than regularly re-creating the input data for the RP model. Third-party services could provide information as to the availability of parking, toilets, places to eat, weather forecast, and other things that people may need to plan their activity.\nScenario analysis:\nThe RP model could become a tool for scenario planning, if users were able to add or remove features from the landscape to simulate possible developments (e.g. a new cycle route), land use changes (e.g. a housing development), or land cover changes (e.g. from climate change forecasts)."

This is a mathematical representation of a single raster layer in a ‘one-hot’ representation, where a value of \\(I(x) = 1\\) indicates presence of a feature at the coordinate \\(x\\), and \\(I(x) = 0\\) indicates absence.\nThe RP model currently includes 87 features/items grouped into four components (see Section 3). Each of these has its own presence/absence raster. We will therefore introduce two subscript indices and write each layer as \\(I_{ij}(x)\\), where\n\n\\(i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) labels the component to which \\(I_{ij}\\) belongs, as specified in Table 1, and\n\\(j \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n_i\\}\\) labels the item/feature within that component, of which there are \\(n_i\\).\n\nAs a concrete example, if \\(j=1\\) labels the ‘pond’ item, then \\(I_{41}(x)\\) takes a value of \\(1\\) whenever there is a pond at \\(x\\), and a value of \\(0\\) elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(i\\)\nComponent\nShort code\n\n\n\n\n1\nLandscape\nSLSRA\n\n\n2\nNatural Features\nFIPS_N\n\n\n3\nInfrastructure\nFIPS_I\n\n\n4\nWater\nWater\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Integer label and short-code for the four components of the RP model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor certain features like rivers and lakes it does not make sense to restrict their contributions to the Recreational Potential to the pixels in which they are present. One does not need to be standing in a lake to appreciate it!1\nIt makes sense to attempt to account for the presence of these features nearby.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{P}_{ij} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\) denote the set of coordinates in which the feature \\((ij)\\) is present, i.e.2\n\\[\n\\mathcal{P}_{ij} := \\left\\{ x' \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid I_{ij}(x') = 1 \\right\\} \\, .\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWe first compute a ‘distance raster’ in which each pixel is assigned a value that is the (Euclidean) distance to the nearest pixel in which the feature \\((ij)\\) is present,\n\\[\nd_{ij}(x) = \\min_{x'\\in \\mathcal{P}_{ij}} \\lVert x - x' \\rVert_2 \\, ,\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lVert x - x' \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x'_1)^2 + (x_2 - x'_2)^2}\\).\nThese distances must be mapped to the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\) such that \\(0 \\mapsto 1\\) and \\(\\infty \\mapsto 0\\), i.e. so that presence of the feature in this pixel results in the highest value of \\(1\\), tailing off to \\(0\\) when the feature is very far away.\nThere are many different ways to achieve this. Following Paracchini et al. (2014, p. 374 – Eq. 1), the function chosen is a smooth, monotonically decreasing function in the logistic family,\n\\[\nu(d_{ij}(x) \\,; \\alpha, \\kappa) = \\frac{\\kappa + 1}{\\kappa + \\exp(\\alpha \\, d_{ij}(x))} \\, .\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIt remains to specify values for the parameters \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\alpha\\), the latter of which is most important since it determines the rate at which the value of \\(u\\) declines as the distance to the nearest feature increases.\nThe parameters chosen in the original version of this code were3\n\\[\n\\kappa = 6 \\, , \\qquad \\alpha = 0.01011 \\, ,\n\\tag{4}\\]\nresulting in a function, Figure 1, that halves at \\(d\\approx200\\) (metres) and drops to \\(0.1\\) at \\(d\\approx400\\).4 At this distance, features with a user-provided score of \\(10\\) (i.e. the highest) would be equivalent to a local feature given a score of \\(1\\) (the lowest). It is safe to assume that at distances greater than this the contribution from the feature would be indiscernible to the user.\n\n\nCode\nalpha &lt;- 0.01011\nkappa &lt;- 6\nlogistic_func &lt;- function(d) {\n    (kappa + 1) / (kappa + exp(alpha * d))\n}\n\nd &lt;- seq(0, 500, by = 1)\nu &lt;- logistic_func(d)\n\nplot(d, logistic_func(d), ylim=c(0, 1), type=\"l\", lwd=2,\n    xlab=expression(\"d\"), ylab=expression(\"u(d, alpha, kappa)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A plot of the function which maps positive distances to the unit interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, there are 87 features in total, each of which corresponds to (a) persona score between \\(0\\) and \\(10\\),\n\\[\n\\rho_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 10\\} \\, ,\n\\tag{5}\\]\nand (b) a raster layer \\(f_{ij}(x)\\). For the landscape and natural features components (i.e. \\(i = 1,2\\)) the feature rasters are precisely the binary presence/absence rasters discussed previously,\n\\[\nf_{ij}(x) = I_{ij}(x) \\, , \\qquad i = 1, 2 \\, .\n\\tag{6}\\]\nFor the infrastructure and water components (\\(i=3, 4\\)) the features rasters contain the proximity contributions described above,\n\\[\nf_{ij}(x) = u(d_{ij}(x) \\,; \\alpha, \\kappa) \\, , \\qquad i = 3, 4 \\, .\n\\tag{7}\\]\nEach component is calculated as a simple weighted sum of the features contained within it,\n\\[\nF_i(x \\,; \\rho_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\rho_{ij} f_{ij}(x) \\, ,\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere we have permitted \\(\\rho_i\\) to denote the set of persona scores \\(\\{\\rho_{i1}, \\rho_{i2}, \\ldots, \\rho_{i n_i} \\}\\) for the \\(i\\)-th component.\n\n\n\nLet \\(F \\vert_{\\mathcal{R}}\\) denote the restriction of a function \\(F\\) to a subdomain \\(\\mathcal{R} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\) which defines the ‘region of interest’ in which we wish to compute Recreational Potential. We now define a family of rescaled functions,\n\\[\n\\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}) := \\frac{F(x) - \\min F \\big\\vert_{\\mathcal{R}}}{\\max F \\big\\vert_{\\mathcal{R}} - \\min F \\big\\vert_{\\mathcal{R}}} \\, ,\n\\tag{9}\\]\neach of which corresponds to a particular choice of restriction, i.e. a particular region of interest.\nAssuming that \\(F(x)\\) is not a constant function on \\(\\mathcal{R}\\),5 these rescaled functions are ‘normalised’ to the unit interval within the region of interest, i.e.\n\\[\n\\min_{x\\in\\mathcal{R}} \\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}) = 0 \\, , \\qquad\n\\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{R}} \\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}) = 1 \\, .\n\\tag{10}\\]\nIt is important to be aware that with this approach to rescaling introduces a dependence on the region of interest. That is,\n\\[\n\\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}_1) \\neq \\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}_2) \\, .\n\\tag{11}\\]\nThus, the RP value at any given pixel should be expected to change when a different area is selected, even if the persona and the input data stays the same.\n\n\n\nTo compute the Recreational Potential value, the four rescaled components are summed,\n\\[\nF_{\\mathrm{RP}}(x \\,; \\rho, \\mathcal{R}) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\hat{F}_i(x \\,; \\rho_i , \\mathcal{R}) \\, ,\n\\tag{12}\\]\nand rescaled \\(F_{\\text{RP}} \\longrightarrow \\hat{F}_\\text{RP}\\) using Equation 9 once more (with the same \\(\\mathcal{R}\\)) so that the result falls in the interval \\([0, 1]\\)."

One does not need to be standing in a lake to appreciate it!1\nIt makes sense to attempt to account for the presence of these features nearby.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{P}_{ij} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\) denote the set of coordinates in which the feature \\((ij)\\) is present, i.e.2\n\\[\n\\mathcal{P}_{ij} := \\left\\{ x' \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid I_{ij}(x') = 1 \\right\\} \\, .\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWe first compute a ‘distance raster’ in which each pixel is assigned a value that is the (Euclidean) distance to the nearest pixel in which the feature \\((ij)\\) is present,\n\\[\nd_{ij}(x) = \\min_{x'\\in \\mathcal{P}_{ij}} \\lVert x - x' \\rVert_2 \\, ,\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lVert x - x' \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x'_1)^2 + (x_2 - x'_2)^2}\\).\nThese distances must be mapped to the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\) such that \\(0 \\mapsto 1\\) and \\(\\infty \\mapsto 0\\), i.e. so that presence of the feature in this pixel results in the highest value of \\(1\\), tailing off to \\(0\\) when the feature is very far away.\nThere are many different ways to achieve this. Following Paracchini et al. (2014, p. 374 – Eq. 1), the function chosen is a smooth, monotonically decreasing function in the logistic family,\n\\[\nu(d_{ij}(x) \\,; \\alpha, \\kappa) = \\frac{\\kappa + 1}{\\kappa + \\exp(\\alpha \\, d_{ij}(x))} \\, .\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIt remains to specify values for the parameters \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\alpha\\), the latter of which is most important since it determines the rate at which the value of \\(u\\) declines as the distance to the nearest feature increases.\nThe parameters chosen in the original version of this code were3\n\\[\n\\kappa = 6 \\, , \\qquad \\alpha = 0.01011 \\, ,\n\\tag{4}\\]\nresulting in a function, Figure 1, that halves at \\(d\\approx200\\) (metres) and drops to \\(0.1\\) at \\(d\\approx400\\).4 At this distance, features with a user-provided score of \\(10\\) (i.e. the highest) would be equivalent to a local feature given a score of \\(1\\) (the lowest). It is safe to assume that at distances greater than this the contribution from the feature would be indiscernible to the user.\n\n\nCode\nalpha &lt;- 0.01011\nkappa &lt;- 6\nlogistic_func &lt;- function(d) {\n    (kappa + 1) / (kappa + exp(alpha * d))\n}\n\nd &lt;- seq(0, 500, by = 1)\nu &lt;- logistic_func(d)\n\nplot(d, logistic_func(d), ylim=c(0, 1), type=\"l\", lwd=2,\n    xlab=expression(\"d\"), ylab=expression(\"u(d, alpha, kappa)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A plot of the function which maps positive distances to the unit interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, there are 87 features in total, each of which corresponds to (a) persona score between \\(0\\) and \\(10\\),\n\\[\n\\rho_{ij} \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 10\\} \\, ,\n\\tag{5}\\]\nand (b) a raster layer \\(f_{ij}(x)\\). For the landscape and natural features components (i.e. \\(i = 1,2\\)) the feature rasters are precisely the binary presence/absence rasters discussed previously,\n\\[\nf_{ij}(x) = I_{ij}(x) \\, , \\qquad i = 1, 2 \\, .\n\\tag{6}\\]\nFor the infrastructure and water components (\\(i=3, 4\\)) the features rasters contain the proximity contributions described above,\n\\[\nf_{ij}(x) = u(d_{ij}(x) \\,; \\alpha, \\kappa) \\, , \\qquad i = 3, 4 \\, .\n\\tag{7}\\]\nEach component is calculated as a simple weighted sum of the features contained within it,\n\\[\nF_i(x \\,; \\rho_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\rho_{ij} f_{ij}(x) \\, ,\n\\tag{8}\\]\nwhere we have permitted \\(\\rho_i\\) to denote the set of persona scores \\(\\{\\rho_{i1}, \\rho_{i2}, \\ldots, \\rho_{i n_i} \\}\\) for the \\(i\\)-th component.\n\n\n\nLet \\(F \\vert_{\\mathcal{R}}\\) denote the restriction of a function \\(F\\) to a subdomain \\(\\mathcal{R} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2\\) which defines the ‘region of interest’ in which we wish to compute Recreational Potential. We now define a family of rescaled functions,\n\\[\n\\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}) := \\frac{F(x) - \\min F \\big\\vert_{\\mathcal{R}}}{\\max F \\big\\vert_{\\mathcal{R}} - \\min F \\big\\vert_{\\mathcal{R}}} \\, ,\n\\tag{9}\\]\neach of which corresponds to a particular choice of restriction, i.e. a particular region of interest.\nAssuming that \\(F(x)\\) is not a constant function on \\(\\mathcal{R}\\),5 these rescaled functions are ‘normalised’ to the unit interval within the region of interest, i.e.\n\\[\n\\min_{x\\in\\mathcal{R}} \\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}) = 0 \\, , \\qquad\n\\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{R}} \\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}) = 1 \\, .\n\\tag{10}\\]\nIt is important to be aware that with this approach to rescaling introduces a dependence on the region of interest. That is,\n\\[\n\\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}_1) \\neq \\hat{F}(x \\,; \\mathcal{R}_2) \\, .\n\\tag{11}\\]\nThus, the RP value at any given pixel should be expected to change when a different area is selected, even if the persona and the input data stays the same.\n\n\n\nTo compute the Recreational Potential value, the four rescaled components are summed,\n\\[\nF_{\\mathrm{RP}}(x \\,; \\rho, \\mathcal{R}) = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\hat{F}_i(x \\,; \\rho_i , \\mathcal{R}) \\, ,\n\\tag{12}\\]\nand rescaled \\(F_{\\text{RP}} \\longrightarrow \\hat{F}_\\text{RP}\\) using Equation 9 once more (with the same \\(\\mathcal{R}\\)) so that the result falls in the interval \\([0, 1]\\)."

That is, the output of this stage is four multi-layered rasters \\((f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4)\\) corresponding to the four components, where \\(f_i := (f_{i1}, f_{i2}, \\ldots, f_{i n_i})\\), whose individual layers \\(f_{ij}\\) are defined by Equation 6 (for \\(i = 1, 2\\)) and Equation 7 (for \\(i=2,3\\)).\nThe process of producing these rasters is currently split into two distinct parts:\n\nA manual part in which categorical rasters are constructed from raw downloaded datasets using QGIS\nA scripted part in which these categorical rasters are converted into the form required by the model, using R.\n\nThe scripted part is executed by running inst/scripts/data_production/main.R (or the containerised version) with the manually-produced categorical rasters already present.

These features can be grouped into different sub-categories:\n\nCP (1 feature) : The Country Parks (CP) feature was sourced from NatureScot (2020).\nHNV (1 feature): The High Nature Value farming feature was sourced from European Environment Agency (2023).\nLCM (28 features): The Land Cover Map (LCM) featured were sourced from NatureScot and Space Intelligence (2023).\nNNR (1 feature): The Natural Nature Reserves (NNR) feature was sourced from NatureScot (2022a)\nNP (1 feature): The National Parks (NP) feature was sourced from Stirling Council (2024)\nNR (1 feature): The Nature Reserves (NR) feature was sourced from NatureScot (2021)\nRP (1 feature): The Regional Parks (RP) feature was sourced from NatureScot (2022b)\nRSPB (1 feature): The Protected sites for birds feature was sourced from Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (2024)\nSAC (1 feature): The Special Area for Conservation (SAC) feature was sourced from NatureScot (2023a)\nSPA (1 feature): The Special Protection Areas (SPA) feature was sourced form NatureScot (2023b)\nSSSI (1 feature): The Sites of Specific Scientific Interest (SSSI) feature was sourced from NatureScot (2024)\nSWT (1 feature): The Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) feature was sourced from Scottish Wildlife Trust (2024)\nWLA (1 feature): The Wild Land Area (WLA) feature was sourced form NatureScot (2014)\n\nThe datasets used for this component were clipped to a Scotland Boundary shapefile (Office for National Statistics, 2018), and they were rasterized to a 20m x 20m resolution.\n\n\n2.2.2 Natural Features component\nThe 24 features in this component are grouped into three main categories:\n\nLandform features (16 features): The landform data was extracted from the Scotland 250K Soils Map. (The James Hutton Institute, 2022). The following methodologies were applied:\n\nDissolve: the dataset was “dissolved” in QGIS using the “Landform“ attribute, reducing it to 334 unique polygon features.\nReclassification: the 334 landform types were manually grouped into 16 broader categories based on descriptive keywords (e.g. “hills”, “foothills” etc…) see (Appendix I: Reclassification info).\nRasterization: the dataset was converted into a raster at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\nSlope features (6 features): Slope data were derived from the Copernicus GLO-30 Digital Elevation Model (DEM), a global 30 m resolution dataset (European Space Agency, 2021). The following methodology was applied:\n\nSlope calculation: the DEM was converted into a matching CRS (EPSG: 27700) using Warp (Reproject) using QGIS, with a slope raster calculated using GDAL Slope with its default settings.\nUp-sampling: the raster was resampled to a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\n\n\n\nSoil features (2 features): The landform data was derived from the Scotland 250K Soils Map (The James Hutton Institute, 2022) The following methodology was applied:\n\nInitial dissolve: The dataset was “dissolved” by field “genSoilTyp” in QGIS, reducing it to 12 unique attribute values.\nGrouping: The values were manually aggregated into two soil classes: organic (peat) and mineral based on the original classifications (see Appendix I: Reclassification info).\nRasterization: the dataset was converted into a raster at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Infrastructure Features component\nThe 10 features are grouped into three main categories:\n\nRoads Tracks (5 features): Road Tracks data was sourced from the OS OpenRoads dataset (Ordnance Survey, 2023b). The following methodologies were applied:\n\nDissolve: The OpenRoads dataset (Ordnance Survey, 2023b) was “dissolved” in QGIS by the field “Road type” and “Tracks”.\nAdding access roads: the attribute field “Access roads” from the OSM_Roads dataset (OpenStreetMap, n.d.) was merged into the dissolved dataset.\nRasterization: the combined dataset was rasterized at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\nCycle Network (4 features): The National Cycle Network data was sourced from the Sustrans National Cycle Network dataset (Sustrans GIS, 2024). The following methodology was applied:\n\nDissolve: The dataset was “dissolved” in QGIS using the two attribute fields “Desc_” and “Surface”.\nGrouping: The “Desc_” features were then grouped in (1) on road, and (2) off road; whilst the “Surface” features grouped in (3) paved and (4) unpaved. This produced four distinct feature classes\nRasterization: The dataset was converted into raster format at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\nLocal Path Network (1 feature): The “Local Path Network” data was sourced from the Scotland’s Core Paths dataset provided by the Improvement Service (2024). The dataset was converted into raster format at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Water component\nThe 13 features can be divided into two categories:\n\nRivers (6 features): The river data was sourced from the Os Open Rivers (Ordnance Survey, 2023a) and the OS Boundaries dataset. The following methodology was applied:\n\nmerging: To avoid naming inconsistencies, the “Region” field from the OS Boundaries dataset was joined to the Os Open Rivers dataset (Ordnance Survey, 2023a).\ninitial dissolve: the merged dataset was “dissolved” in QGIS using the “name” and “Region” fields. This combined river segments sharing the same name and region into single features, reducing the dataset into 74 997 features.\nReclassification: To simplify the river data at a national scale, a reclassification was carried out (see Appendix I: Reclassification info for examples). This is a subjective and based on:  the “form” attribute (indicating water type), or keywords searches in the “name” field, and researcher knowledge of major rivers of national and regional importance.\nRasterization: the dataset was converted into raster format at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\n\n\n\nLakes (7 features): The lakes data was sourced from the Spatial inventory of UK waterbodies dataset (Taylor, 2021). The following methodology was applied:\n\nReclassification: The dataset contained 25404 features for Scotland. To make it into a relevant and scorable dataset it was reduced to six features based on the given size (in hectares) of a waterbody using the attribute “Poly_Area_Ha” (see Appendix I: Reclassification info).\nRasterization: the datasets were converted into raster format at a 20 m x 20 m resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Quantising the slope raster\nWith one exception, every raster layer produced by the manual process is an integer-valued categorical raster. The single exception is a ‘slope’ raster containing the average absolute gradient \\(s(x)\\) within each pixel.\nWe use terra::classify to quantise this continuous range into six categories according to their steepness (expressed in degrees), this was based on the six classification slopes (expressed in percentage) of Dick et al. (2022) (see Table below).\n\\[\nC_{\\text{slope}}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & &0 \\leq s(x) &lt; 1.72 \\\\\n2 & &1.72 \\leq s(x) &lt; 2.86 \\\\\n3 & &2.86 \\leq s(x) &lt; 5.71 \\\\\n4 & &5.71 \\leq s(x) &lt; 11.31 \\\\\n5 & &11.31 \\leq s(x) &lt; 16.7 \\\\\n6 & &16.7 \\leq s(x) \\, .\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{13}\\]\n\nSix classification slopes (%) used, adapted from Dick et al. (2022)\n\n\nSlope (%)\nSlope description\n\n\n\n\n&lt;3\neasy\n\n\n3-5\ngentle slope\n\n\n5-10\nmedium slope\n\n\n10-20\nsteep slope\n\n\n20-30\nvery steep slope\n\n\n&gt;30\nextremely steep slope\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Reprojection\nThe categorical rasters produced in the previous stage do not necessarily share the exact same coordinate grid. They can be coerced to share the same grid using terra::project.\nWe projected all rasters onto a reference raster with the following properties:\n\nCoordinate reference system (CRS): EPSG:27700 (British National Grid)\nResolution: 20 metres x 20 metres\nExtent: \\((x_\\text{min}, x_\\text{max}, y_\\text{min}, y_\\text{max}) = (-10000, 660000, 460000, 1220000)\\), which is a rectangular box around Scotland.\n\nWe used the ‘nearest’ interpolation mode (method=\"near\") since the data is categorical. The reprojected rasters therefore contain the same set of integer values as the original rasters.\n\n\n2.5 Conversion to one-hot representation\nThe next stage converts the categorical rasters (\\(C_i(x) \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n_i\\}\\) into a set of presence/absence rasters for each feature. These binary-valued rasters are referred to as the one-hot representation of the data.\nConsider the following categorical raster,\n\\[\nC_i = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\ddots \\\\\n& 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n& 2 & 1 & 3 & \\\\\n& & & & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix} \\, .\n\\tag{14}\\]\nThe one-hot encoding of this raster is written\n\\[\nC_i \\overset{\\text{one hot}}{\\longrightarrow} ( I_{i0}, I_{i1}, I_{i2}, I_{i3}, \\ldots) \\, ,\n\\tag{15}\\]\nwhere the binary-valued presence/absence rasters are, in this case,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nI_{i0} &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\ddots \\\\\n& 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\\n& & & & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix} \\, , \\quad\nI_{i1} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\ddots \\\\\n& 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n& 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\\n& & & & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix} \\, , \\\\\nI_{i2} &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\ddots \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\\n& & & & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix} \\, , \\quad\nI_{i3} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\ddots \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& 0 & 0 & 1 & \\\\\n& & & & \\ddots\n\\end{bmatrix} \\, .\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{16}\\]\nThe implementation of this step involves the use of terra::lapp to parallelise the calculation over the spatial domain.

Roughly speaking, we do\n# Construct a list of rasters from each .tif file in `infiles`\nrasters &lt;- lapply(infiles, terra::rast)\n\n# Construct a single multi-layered raster from this list\nstacked &lt;- terra::rast(rasters)\n\n# Re-apply layer names\nlayer_names &lt;- unlist(lapply(rasters, names))\nnames(stacked) &lt;- layer_names\n\n# Write the combined raster to disk\nterra::writeRaster(stacked, outfile)\nNote that terra::rast(rasters) does not preserve layer names when rasters is a list of rasters, hence the need for the two lines prior to writeRaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA warning about layer names\n\n\n\nIt is very unfortunate that the names we have used for the layers follow the same format (filename_i for integers i) as the names that are automatically generated by terra::rast. Because of this, if these two lines that re-apply layer names are omitted, it is not obvious that anything is wrong; no error will be thrown and one can go onto compute RP values, since the names are as expected.\nHowever, the results will be wrong, since terra::rast will apply the right names in the wrong order.\nFuture developers are strongly recommended to fix this problem by using different layer names. This issue and suggested solutions are discussed in depth in the Developers’ Report.\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Proximity contributions\nThis stage applies Equation 2 and Equation 3 to each layer of the Infrastructure and Water components.\nIn fact Equation 2 is the most challenging computation in the whole processing pipeline, due to the fact that its memory requirements scale poorly with the size of the input raster.\nEvery single other processing step is entirely local; all of the information required to generate an output value for a pixel at coordinate \\(x\\) is contained in the input pixels at coordinate \\(x\\). This makes it trivial to process the data in chunks, and memory costs scale linearly with the area of the chunks.\nIn contrast, calculating distance to the nearest feature is strongly non-local; the output value at \\(x\\) is a function of the full set of input values. Naively, the entire raster must be loaded to compute the output at a single location.\nTo perform this calculation we used terra::distance. It is not necessarily true that the underlying C++ implementation of GDALComputeProximity, which is called by terra::distance, actually loads the entire raster into memory immediately. However, for Scotland at 20 metre resolution, we found that the memory requirements for this distance calculation (several 10s of GB) surpass the typical memory available on a standard personal computer by an order of magnitude.\nTo get around this issue, the original Scotland-wide raster was divided into 20 overlapping spatial ‘windows’. Note that the size of the overlap needed to be at least as large as the effective cutoff distance of 500m. After the distance step was complete within each window, the windows were stitched together, discarding the overlaps.\nThe distance raster was also truncated at 500m, setting any values above this to NA which simply passes through the function applying Equation 3 and ensures that we don’t waste disk space storing high-precision floats that are functionally equivalent to zero.\n\n2.7.1 Visual demonstration\nTODO: Madda - make this figure static for pdf?\nTo account for proximity effects, the distance from each cell to the nearest infrastructure feature was calculated using the terra::distance() function in R. The resulting raster, labeled “distance” in the example map, contains the distance in meters from the center of each cell to the nearest feature. This raster is named “scored” in the example map, using the distance decay function."

The precision with which \\(\\alpha\\) is given is a particular curiosity.↩︎\nNote that this does not exhibit the classic ‘S’ shape of logistic curves since the domain is restricted to the positive real line (distances are non-negative!).↩︎\nIf \\(F(x)\\) is constant in the region of interest then the right-hand-side of Equation 9 diverges and \\(\\hat{F}\\) is undefined.↩︎"
